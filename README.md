## What is that?
This is a small command line utility I wrote, because it annoyed me that Discord always replaces <3 with a ❤

### Is this a Virus?
No, but we need to spy constantly on your keyboard to make it a universal tool for all platforms. Thats why you need to compile it yourself! NEVER EVER download a binary for it from somewhere else!
## TODO
Add config file for more shortages
